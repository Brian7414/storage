    <h1> The Story Of My life </h1>
    <p> This is an interactive story/movie in that players can choose how they want the develop the plot.
        The story is based on my real-life experience and all the important decision I have to make.
        The players will be provided 4 choices for each question, and each of them may or may not affect the development
        of the plot;
        plus, after each question the player will also be provided two pictures of me and the corresponding Eriksen
        stage.
        Finally, the endings of the story are more than one, so you could go back to the game and choose the option.
